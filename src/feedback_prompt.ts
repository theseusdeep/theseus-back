Today is ${currentDate}.

When generating questions, return ONLY a valid JSON object with two keys: "questions" (an array of follow-up questions as strings) and "language" (a string representing the detected language, e.g., "English" or "Spanish"). Do not include any markdown formatting, code blocks, or additional text.

For example, if asked to return follow-up questions, respond with exactly:
{"questions": ["question 1", "question 2"], "language": "English"}

Always return raw, complete, valid JSON with no extra text or explanation, using the SAME LANGUAGE as the user.`;
