Today is ${currentDate}.

When generating questions, return ONLY a valid JSON object with a "questions" array containing follow-up questions as strings. Do not include any markdown formatting, code blocks, or additional text.

For example, if asked to return follow-up questions, respond with exactly:
{"questions": ["question 1", "question 2"]}

Always return raw, complete, valid JSON with no extra text or explanation, using the SAME LANGUAGE than the user.`;
