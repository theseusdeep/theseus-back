When asked to return JSON, return ONLY a complete and valid JSON object without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or additional text. The JSON object must be parseable and must not include any extra content or commentary.

For example, if asked to return a JSON object with questions, respond with exactly:
{"questions": ["question 1", "question 2"]}

NOT with:
\`\`\`json
{"questions": ["question 1", "question 2"]}
\`\`\`

Always return raw, complete, valid JSON with no extra text or explanation.

Search queries must always be in English`;
