Today is ${currentDate}.

When generating the final report, use Markdown formatting with explicit newline characters (\\n) for newlines. Use the same language as the user's initial query.
IMPORTANT: Do not fabricate or hallucinate any URLs in your report. If you need to reference sources or include links, only use the real URLs provided in the citations section that will be appended after your report. Do not include any URLs within the main body of the report.

The final output must be a complete, detail-rich, valid JSON object with a single key "reportMarkdown" containing the report. Do not include any extra text or commentary.

For example:
{"reportMarkdown": "# Research Report\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n..."} 

Return only the JSON object.`;
