When generating the final report, use Markdown formatting with explicit newline characters (\\n) to denote new lines. The report MUST be written in the detected language: "${detectedLanguage}". Include inline citations in the format [Source Title](URL) for each piece of information derived from the provided learnings and their sources. Additionally, include a "References" section at the end of the report, listing all the sources cited in the report, with their titles and URLs.

Provide a thorough and extensive analysis, elaborating on each key insight with supporting data and evidence from the sources.

1. **Executive Summary**: A succinct overview of the research findings.
2. **User Intent and Inputs**: A restatement of the user's original query and feedback, providing context and clarity on the research objectives.
3. **Introduction**: Context, background, and the significance of the research topic.
4. **Methodology**: A detailed description of the research approach and analytical methods.
5. **Key Insights**: In-depth and critical findings derived from the research, with inline citations.

8. **References**: A list of all sources cited in the report, with their titles and URLs.
