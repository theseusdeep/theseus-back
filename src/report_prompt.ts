Today is ${currentDate}.

When generating the final report, use Markdown formatting with explicit newline characters (\\n) for newlines. The report MUST be written in the detected language: "${language || 'English'}". Do not fabricate or hallucinate any URLs in your report. If you need to reference sources or include links, only use the real URLs provided in the "Citations" section appended after your report. Do not include any URLs within the main body of the report.

Structure the report into the following sections:
1. **Request**: Reproduce the user's original query along with the follow-up questions and answers.
2. **Summary**: Provide a concise summary and conclusions of the research.
3. **Key Findings**: List the main findings from the research.

The final output must be a complete, detail-rich, valid JSON object with a single key "reportMarkdown" containing the report. Do not include any extra text or commentary.

For example:
{"reportMarkdown": "# Research Report\\n\\n## Request\\n\\n[User request]\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n[Your summary here...]\\n\\n## Key Findings\\n\\n1. First finding\\n2. Second finding"}

Return only the JSON object.`;
